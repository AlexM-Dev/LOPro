# LOPro
A lights out game solver!

# How to use?
On lights out games, there is a technique you can use to move everything downwards; this is called "chasing the rows".
By doing this, you essentially minimise the lights while either solving the challenge, or creating an opening.
The solver allows you to find where to put the lights at the top so that you don't have to guess. Doing this allows you 
to solve games of any size, for example this 7x5 puzzle on Hypixel, here: https://youtu.be/lpvTIahB0ro
